### Infos:

Receive and listen to FM and AM radio broadcasts on your browser using an *RTL-SDR* (RTL2832U-chip) USB digital TV tuner.

This application does FM and AM demodulation in the browser and can capture the radio signals as *.wav

* This version was improved with adjustable styles, window-sizes and better permission controls

* Supports most compatible R820T & *T2* tuner chip now  (maybe some E4000!?) !! 

See [Compatibility-List](docs/pidvids.txt) (incl. PID & VID)

Features:
* Scanner
* Recorder
* Free-tuning mode for short wave, air band, marine band, etc.
* Supported modes: Wideband FM, Narrowband FM, AM, SSB.
* Some Frequencies requires an up/down-converter for shifting!

Use '. dot' as decimal-comma separator! 

Radio works with *.wav-file with 16-bit PCM @ 48000 [Hz] mono & stereo / 1-12.000 [MHz] range. (maybe 0.001 later)

- Tip: You could use just a copper wire for 2 m/70 cm-band or other lambda(1/4)-antennas (17.5cm/6.9in for PMR)

or any other antenna-configuration you like to use if you're an advanced amateur-radio-operator.

You can use an LNA for improving signal-strength or Bias-T (12V vertical or 18 V horizontal) setup for satellites @ 10-12 GHz.

___

### Warnings:

- Use (original) power supply ~5 V/500 mA via miniUSB 2.0

- Antenna should be grounded if possible

- You should use tested Antennas! 

- You can try to smooth the signal out with a 1:X-balloon if using long HF antenna

- Dummy-load: 0.5-100 W @ 50 Ohm "cement" or similar with cooling-ribs with fan for testing

### Disclaimer:

- Private Project! Work in Progress (WIP)
